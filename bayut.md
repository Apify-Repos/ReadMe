## ‚¨áÔ∏è Input

For simple usecase, you just need to provide browser url of bayut search result page & that's all. You can leave other fields as they are to be sensible defaults.

### Input example


```json
{
    "listUrls": [
        {
            "url": "https://www.bayut.com/for-sale/3-bedroom-apartments/dubai/dubai-marina/"
        }
    ],
    "propertyUrls": [
        {
            "url": "https://www.bayut.com/property/details-8023002.html"
        }
    ],
    "fullScrape": true,
    "monitoringMode": false,
    "includePriceHistory": false,
    "enableDelistingTracker" : false
}
```

You can either provide `listUrls` to search properties from or provide `propertyUrls` directly to crawl.

Understading monitoring mode :

- `fullScrape` : This option is by default turned on. When enabled it always force actor to scrape complete listing from all pagination pages regardless of monitoring is enabled or not.


- `monitoringMode` : This option when turned on will only scrape newly added property listings compared to previously scraped properties by this actor. It's important to turn off fullScrape setting if you are using this mode. If you keep fullScrape on, it will re-scrape complete listing again.

- `includePriceHistory` : This option when turned on will also scrape procie history of given property when available with bayut. This may affect the speed of scraping considerably. Please turn it on only if you need this data.

- `enableDelistingTracker` : This option when turned on will start tracking date against each property under Apify Key Value store. This KV store can be queried later to find out which properties are delisted.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Output

The scraped data is stored in the dataset of each run. The data can be viewed or downloaded in many popular formats, such as *JSON, CSV, Excel, XML, RSS, and HTML*.

## ‚ùìLimitations

Since Bayut allows only 50000 properties per listing/search result, you might want to break down your listing urls into smaller area if it has more than 50K results. Good News is that even if multiple list urls contains overlapping results, they will get deduplicated within same run data.

## üîé Identifying delisted properties

This actor provides you monitoring mode configuration using which you can get only incremental updates about newly added properties. In case, you also want to identify which properties are delisted from platform, you can use any of the following techniques with the help of this actor.

1. Running Always in full scraper mode :
    Run this actor always in full scrape mode and cross check the new incoming batch of data with your existing database. If any property that exists in yoru database but not in newly scraped data batch, that means it's not listed anymore

2. Use Key Value Store generated by scraper :
    If your are monitoring very large batch of data and you don't want to scrape everything all the time, this method involves bit of technicality but achieves the goal efectively. Apify has storage feature called [Key-value store](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection/get-list-of-keys). When you run this scrape, this scraper stores every single property in key value store along with timestamp in `bayut-properties` store. Inside this store, key is property id itself and value is timestamp like this

    ```
    { lastSeen : '2023-11-02T05:59:25.763Z'}
    ```

    Whenever you run this scraper, it will update the timestamp against particular id if it finds property on the platform. e.g. if we have 2 proprties with id `prop1` and `prop2` and we scraped them both on November 1, key value storage would look like this :

    ```
    prop1 -> { lastSeen : '2023-11-01T05:59:25.763Z'}
    prop2 -> { lastSeen : '2023-11-01T05:59:25.763Z'}
    ```

    Now if you run this scraper again on December 1 and prop1 is not on the platform anymore but prop2 is still there, key value storage would change like this :

    ```
    prop1 -> { lastSeen : '2023-11-01T05:59:25.763Z'}
    prop2 -> { lastSeen : '2023-12-01T05:59:25.763Z'}
    ```

    That means if any property has `lastSeen` less than latest batch you loaded, that property is delisted now. You can directly iterate through whole Key value storage using Apify key value storage API to identify this. Please refer to [this](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection/get-list-of-keys) API documentation to do the same. Please remember store name generated by this scrape will be `bayut-properties`.

    Alternatively, you can iterate through your existing database active properties and use [this](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2/#/reference/key-value-stores/record/get-record) API to identify listing status.

    For this approach to work, it's important that you enable this feature via `enableDelistingTracker` (Enable Delisting tracker) input.
